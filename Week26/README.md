# Week 26: Final Capstone - Polish, OTA Updates, & Launch 🚀

## Overview

Welcome to the final week of your 180-day React Native journey! This week is about polish, advanced features, career preparation, and celebration. You'll implement OTA updates, deep linking, improve accessibility, polish your portfolio, prepare for technical interviews, and plan your next steps as a professional React Native developer. By the end of this week, you'll be fully job-ready. This is the culmination of everything you've learned and is the final step towards our main goal of **becoming a job-ready React Native developer**.

## Daily Plan

### Day 1: OTA Updates & Rollback Strategy
*   **Task:**
    - **Implement OTA Updates (if not done in Week 24):**
      - **Expo Projects:** Configure expo-updates
        ```bash
        eas update:configure
        eas update --branch production --message "Bug fixes and improvements"
        ```
      - **Bare React Native:** Integrate CodePush
        ```bash
        npm install react-native-code-push
        appcenter codepush release-react -a username/AppName-iOS
        ```
    - **Create Update Strategy:**
      - Critical updates: force update immediately
      - Feature updates: optional, user can dismiss
      - Background updates: silent, applied on next app launch
    - **Implement Version Checking:**
      - Check for updates on app launch
      - Show "Update Available" dialog
      - Download and install updates
      - Rollback mechanism if update causes crashes
    - **Test OTA Updates:**
      - Publish test update with small change
      - Verify app updates without app store
      - Test rollback if update fails
      - Monitor update adoption rate
    - **Set up staged rollouts:**
      - Release to 10% of users first
      - Monitor crash rate
      - Gradually increase to 100%
    - **Documentation:**
      - Document how to publish updates
