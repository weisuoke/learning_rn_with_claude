# Week 22: End-to-End Testing with Detox & Final Features

## Overview

This is the final week of building SocialConnect! You'll add E2E tests with Detox to test real user flows on actual simulators/devices. You'll also implement the final features to make your app complete: user search, notifications UI, and settings. By the end of the week, you'll have a fully-featured, tested, production-ready mobile application. This builds on your existing React knowledge and is a crucial step towards our main goal of **becoming a job-ready React Native developer**.

## Portfolio Project: SocialConnect - Week 6/6

**This Week's Goals:**
- Set up Detox for E2E testing
- Write E2E tests for critical user flows
- Implement user search and discovery
- Build notifications UI
- Create settings screen
- Final polish and bug fixes
- Prepare app for deployment

## Daily Plan

### Day 1: Detox Setup & First E2E Test
*   **Theory:** Read [Detox documentation](https://wix.github.io/Detox/). Understand E2E testing philosophy: test the app as a real user would.
*   **Practice:**
    - Install Detox: `npm install --save-dev detox`
    - Install detox-cli: `npm install -g detox-cli`
    - Initialize Detox: `detox init`
    - Configure Detox for iOS and Android in `package.json` or `.detoxrc.json`
    - Build app for testing: `detox build -c ios.sim.debug`
    - Run first test: `detox test -c ios.sim.debug`
    - Write first E2E test (login flow):
      ```js
      describe('Login Flow', () => {
        it('should login successfully with valid credentials', async () => {
          await element(by.id('email-input')).typeText('user@example.com');
          await element(by.id('password-input')).typeText('password123');
          await element(by.id('login-button')).tap();
          await expect(element(by.id('feed-screen'))).toBeVisible();
        });
      });
      ```
    - Add testID props to components for Detox selectors
    - Understand matchers: `by.id`, `by.text`, `by.type`
